See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
limitations under the License.

The node-oracledb test suite uses 'mocha', 'should' and 'async'.  See
[LICENSE](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
for relevant licenses.

## 1. Preparations for running tests

See [INSTALL](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
for installation requirements and more details.

Note: the
[test suite](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/tree/master/test)
is in GitHub.  From node-oracledb 1.9.1 it is not included when
installing from npmjs.com with `npm install oracledb`.

### 1.1 Create a working directory

```
mkdir <some-directory>
cd <some-directory>
```

### 1.2 Get node-oracledb from GitHub

Clone the project repository:

```
cd <some-directory>
git clone https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb.git
```

### 1.3 Build

```
cd <some-directory>/node-oracledb
npm install
```

Running `npm install` within the node-oracledb/ directory will recompile
oracledb and install all its dependent modules.  These are listed
in the `devDependencies` field of `package.json` file.  Thus, 'mocha', 'async'
and 'should' modules are installed by this command.

The test suite uses [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha),
[async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async) and
[should](https://www.npmjs.com/package/should).

### 1.4 Configure Database credentials

The database credentials for node-oracledb test suite are defined in `dbconfig.js`.
They can also be set via environment variables shown in that file.


```
vi <some-directory>/node-oracledb/test/dbconfig.js
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  user          : process.env.NODE_ORACLEDB_USER || "hr",
  password      : process.env.NODE_ORACLEDB_PASSWORD || "welcome",
  connectString : process.env.NODE_ORACLEDB_CONNECTIONSTRING || "localhost/orcl",
  externalAuth  : process.env.NODE_ORACLEDB_EXTERNALAUTH ? true : false
};
```

To use external authentication, set the `externalAuth` property to
`true`.  Also make sure Oracle Database and the authentication service
have been appropriately configured.  See
[Documentation for External Authentication](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/doc/api.md#extauth)
for more details.

Note: the test suite requires a schema with these privileges:

- CREATE TABLE
- CREATE SESSION
- CREATE PROCEDURE
- CREATE SEQUENCE
- CREATE TRIGGER

### 1.5 Set NODE_PATH

```bash
export NODE_PATH=<some-directory>/node-oracledb/lib
```

## 2. Run tests

### 2.1 Run the complete test suite

#### 2.1.1 On Unix-like systems

```
cd <some-directory>/node-oracledb
npm test
```

This calls the `test` script defined in `oracledb/package.json`.

#### 2.1.2 On Windows

```
cd <some-directory>/node_oracledb
npm run-script testWindows
```

This calls the `testWindows` script defined in `oracledb/package.json`.

See [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) for more information
about how npm handles the "scripts" field of `package.json`.

### 2.2 Run specified test(s)

```
cd <some-directory>/node_oracledb
<mocha-executable-file-directory>/mocha test/<test-names>
```

See [mochajs.org](http://mochajs.org/) for more information on running tests with mocha.

## 3. Add Tests
See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for general information on contribution requirements.

For easy correlation between results and test code, each test is
assigned a number. The following number ranges have been chosen:

- 1  - 20  are reserved for basic functional tests
- 21 - 50  are reserved for data type supporting tests
- 51 onwards are for other tests

In order to include your tests in the suite, add each new test file
name to test/opts/mocha.opts. Please also add a description of each
individual test to test/list.txt.

## 4. Test Index

See [`test/list.txt`](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/test/list.txt)
for the list of existing tests.

## 5. Tests Compatibility

- We conduct base testing with Instant Client 11.2.0.4 and 12.1.0.2 on Linux X64
and Windows 7.

- Users of 11.2.0.1 and 11.2.0.2 clients may see failures with poolTimeout.js
and dataTypeDouble.js.

- Slow networks may cause some tests to timeout.
